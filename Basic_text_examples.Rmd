## Working with Text 

Computer systems use an encoding method to store text

Encoding is usually done at the symbol level, so each letter, number or
punctuation mark used in human writing is given an integer code.

There are many different encodings in use,   different languages use different
encodings, and there are multiple encodings in use in English

There are R tools to detect the encoding in a file, see

https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/stringi/html/stri_enc_detect.html

R can readily convert between encodings and can be used to try to estimate the
encoding used in a given file

# Character or string arrays

To store a word, or a longer piece of text,  we store it as an array of integer
encoding values, which the system interprets as text

Files or SQL tables often contain text,   names of people, places etc

We may often want to

-parse text,  meaning break it down into component pieces or elements,  such as
a persons first and last name,   or extract a city name from an address

-search text for specific values

-extract numbers (such as phone numbers) from strings

-find particular words and replace them with other words

-convert cases (upper/lower)

# Regular Expressions,  or Regex

This is a set of methods for searching text.   They were invented by a 
mathematician Stephen Kleene in 1951, and are typically available in many 
computer languages and systems.

Regex based tools were implemented in the Unix operating system in the 1970s, 
and in the language Perl around 1980.

Regex allows for specifying all kinds of different patterns in text,  allowing
for wild card values,  allowing for alternative patterns,  specifying case,
looking for numerals, or punctuation, etc.

We can't really teach Regex fully in this course, it is a big subject.  We will 
use it in a simple way in the homework, but if you are doing a lot of text 
processing, you should go through a tutorial on regex,  it will save you a lot
of time

#Unix or Perl style text searching in R

R has an implementation of many Unix or Perl style tools for text manipulation
built into base R.

If you are familiar with these, the following tools that all use Regex are available in R

  grep
  grepl
  sub
  gsub
  regexpr
  gregexper
  regexec
  gregexec

If you have used regex in other languages, you can read up on these functions in
R and continue using regex.

The Cheat Sheet for Stringr has a discussion of regex on the second page, this
is a good starting point afor learning regex and a handy table if you know 
regex

#Stringr

The Stringr package in R is a slightly easier to use set of tools for
manipulating strings in R.   It really does exactly what the regex family of
functions above does, but Stringr is easier to use

As with many things in R, there are multiple valid ways to do things,  the 
regex/Unix/Perl style functions in base R and the fancier functions in
stringr

Stringr is easier to learn,   but the regex/Unix/Perl methods are avaiable in
most other languages and database systems,   Stringr is unique to R

#How will you work with text?

Typically you will see text in one of several forms

-as entries in a data frame or data table
    -things like names, addresses, descriptions
-as a block of written text,  such as a memo or a story or a news article
-as short chunks of text,  such as reviews, tweets(or whatever X calls them now)
-as documents with tables or graphs that were meant for human readers, not
   as machine-readable data storage
   
We can work with single character strings at a time,  or with vectors of 
characters strings such as we would see in a dataframe


# Detecting a specific pattern in a string

We can look for a pattern of symbols in a given string

```{R}
require("stringr")

text_a="Welcome back to school"

text_b="John is going to school"

str_detect(text_a,"school")

str_detect(text_a,"is")

str_detect(text_b,"is")

```

Working with an Array of strings

```{R}
string_a=c("bob is here","jose is there","sue is home","andy is here")

#note the pattern being detected in this instance is " here",  using "here" also
#detects "there"

str_detect(string_a," here")


```
#Subsetting strings

We will often want to break text up into component pieces

We might want to extract the name from each of the phrases in string_a above

We can do this using a string split function

```{R}

# the inputs are the string to be split, the pattern or delimiter to split on
# and the number of splits to make 
# here we are splitting the array of strings, splitting each string on a space
# and making up to 3 splits

my_splits=str_split_fixed(string_a," ",3)

my_splits

```
We could then extract the list of first names

```{R}
names=my_splits[,1]
names


```
This approach is handy for extracting first and last names or telephone number
from text

#Removing white space

Sometimes text will have extra white space we don't want

string trimming will remove that.

```{R}
#the text below has excess white space

text_c=" Jane Doe "

str_trim(text_c,side="both")
```

# Case conversion

string searches are always case sensitive

it is often a good idea to convert large volumes of text to all lower case
before searching for a specific word

```{R}
text_d="Dear Sir, It has come to our attention that your bill is overdue"

str_detect(text_d,"sir")

text_d=str_to_lower(text_d)

str_detect(text_d,"sir")

```



```{r}

```
